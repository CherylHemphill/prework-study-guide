        <li>The br element creates a line of empty space.</li>
        <li>The a element stands for anchor and creates links to the same webpage or other webpages.</li>

      <h2>CSS</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>CSS is a programming language used by developers to define how webpage content is presented to users.</li>
        <li>There are three ways to style a webpage using CSS: inline CSS, internal CSS style sheet, and external CSS style sheet.</li>
        <li>Inline styles apply to a specific HTML tag.</li>
        <li>Internal style sheet contains CSS rules for the webpage in the head section of the HTML file. </li>
        <li>External CSS style sheet is preferred in most cases because it allows developers to keep all their CSS rules in a separate file.</li>
        <li>When using external CSS a link element is used in the head to place the style in the HTML.</li>
        <li>The rel attribute specifies the relationship between the current document and the linked document resource.</li>
        <li>The href attribute specifies the location (URL) of the external resource. </li>
        <li>The wild card symbol, *, is used to apply a rule to all the elements visible on the page.</li>
        <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
        <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
      </ul>

    <h2>Git</h2>
    <ul>
<li>git status : checks what branch we are currently on</li>
<li>git checkout -b branch-name :creates a new branch and switches to it</li>
<li>git add -A : add command adds modifications in the current working branch and the -A flaf indicates that we want to add all changes</li>
<li>git pull origin main : pull command to receive a branch's modifications into the local enviroment. Origin keyword indicates the source of the pull will be in the GitHub repo from the main branch.</li>
<li>It is important to always do a git pull to make sure that you have the latest version of the project on your local computer.</li>
<li>git push origin feature/branch-name : used to push the changes we have locally to our remote GitHub branch</li>
   <li>git commit -m "message" : the -m flag associates a message with the commit. Commit messages should be short descriptive messages of the changes made.</li>
   <li>It is a good habit to always pull before we push to make sure it is up to date.</li>
   <li>After updating code is VS return to command line and prepare for merge with git commands : git add -A , git commit -m "message" , git pull origin main , git push origin feature/nameofbranch</li>
   <li>After merging in GitHub return to terminal and begin pull to local computer: git checkout main , git pull origin main</li>
