      <h2>HTML</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>HTML is the frame for the site.</li>
        <li>We use semantic HTML elements to indicate the role of their content, as well as to give structure to the content of the webpage.</li>
        <li>The head element contains information about the webpage. </li>
        <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
        <li>Declarations are not case sensitive but elemenst are case sensitve.</li>
        <li>The head contains metadata and metadata elements contain information about the page.</li>
        <li>The br element creates a line of empty space.</li>
        <li>The a element stands for anchor and creates links to the same webpage or other webpages.</li>
        <li>The href attribute points to the URL for the the link</li>
        <li> The element div creates a divison is the page and element span creates an inline division.</li>
        <li>When adding an imagine the src attribute defines the location, or source, of the image file. The alt attribute contains a string of text that describes the appearance and function of the imagine. </li>
        <li>HTML uses the id attribute as a way to identify elements and select them.</li>
        <li>Closing tags begin with the forward slash</li>
        <li>When creating bullet pouint list the element ul creates the unordered list. Following lines with the element li create the line for information input.</li>

      <h2>CSS</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>CSS is a programming language used by developers to define how webpage content is presented to users.</li>
        <li>There are three ways to style a webpage using CSS: inline CSS, internal CSS style sheet, and external CSS style sheet.</li>
        <li>Inline styles apply to a specific HTML tag.</li>
        <li>Internal style sheet contains CSS rules for the webpage in the head section of the HTML file. </li>
        <li>External CSS style sheet is preferred in most cases because it allows developers to keep all their CSS rules in a separate file.</li>
        <li>When using external CSS a link element is used in the head to place the style in the HTML.</li>
        <li>The rel attribute specifies the relationship between the current document and the linked document resource.</li>
        <li>The href attribute specifies the location (URL) of the external resource. </li>
        <li>The wild card symbol, *, is used to apply a rule to all the elements visible on the page.</li>
        <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
        <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
      </ul>

    <section class="card" id="git-section">
    <h2>Git</h2>
    <ul>
<li>git status : checks what branch we are currently on</li>
<li>git checkout -b branch-name :creates a new branch and switches to it</li>
<li>git add -A : add command adds modifications in the current working branch and the -A flaf indicates that we want to add all changes</li>
<li>git pull origin main : pull command to receive a branch's modifications into the local enviroment. Origin keyword indicates the source of the pull will be in the GitHub repo from the main branch.</li>
<li>It is important to always do a git pull to make sure that you have the latest version of the project on your local computer.</li>
<li>git push origin feature/branch-name : used to push the changes we have locally to our remote GitHub branch</li>
   <li>git commit -m "message" : the -m flag associates a message with the commit. Commit messages should be short descriptive messages of the changes made.</li>
   <li>It is a good habit to always pull before we push to make sure it is up to date.</li>
   <li>After updating code is VS return to command line and prepare for merge with git commands : git add -A , git commit -m "message" , git pull origin main , git push origin feature/nameofbranch</li>
   <li>After merging in GitHub return to terminal and begin pull to local computer: git checkout main , git pull origin main</li>

  <h2>JavaScript</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>JavaScript (JS) is a high-level dynamic programming language that allows users to interact with websites. </li>
    <li>The .js file extension indicates that this file is a JavaScript file.</li>
    <li>To declare a variable we use the var keyword and after give the variable a name.</li>
    <li>A string is contained in quotation marks "".</li>
    <li>A semicolon at the end of a line indicates where a statement ends.</li>
    <li>JavaScript is case sensitive.</li>
    <li>Control flow is the order a computer executes code and JS rusn from first statement a the top of the page down to the last statement of page.</li>
    <li>Conditional statements and loops control the order in which code is executed.</li>
    <li>The equality operator === checks to see if two values are equal</li>
    <li>An Array is a group of realted data and the for command creates a loop to perform a task on each piece of data.</li>
    <li>The loop starting point begins at the beginning we declare a variable as x and give it the value of 0. var x = 0;</li>
    <li>The second part is the condition. If the variable x is less than the length of the array the loop will continue to run. x <variabletopic.lenght;</li>
    <li>The final portion allows the array to iterate over each item by increasing the number by 1. x++</li>
    <li>Creating a loop use the code for(var x = 0; x < variabletopic.length; x++){console.log(variabletopic[x]);}</li>
    <li>At times code needs to be ignored but not deleted for future use if needed. Commenting out code makes it inactive using the code /* before the code and */ after the block of code.</li>
